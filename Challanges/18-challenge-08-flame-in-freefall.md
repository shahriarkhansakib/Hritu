# Challenge 08: Flame in Freefall

**Tags:** AI & microgravity safety · Advanced · Intermediate

## Brief

### What the challenge asks

Apply AI to decades of microgravity combustion research to produce fire-safety insight for spacecraft. Fire behaves differently without buoyancy — flames become spherical, spread slowly, and can survive in conditions that would extinguish them on Earth.

### The build

A flammability explorer. Set oxygen concentration, pressure, flow velocity and material, and a model trained on published microgravity combustion results predicts the flame-spread regime, with an explanation layer that cites the experiments behind the prediction.

> **Killer demo**
>
> Slide oxygen from 21 down to 17 percent. The prediction crosses a boundary and the explanation names the experiments on either side of that boundary, with their report identifiers.

### Where the points are

This challenge explicitly asks for AI, which is a trap and an opportunity. The opportunity: a trained model plus a retrieval layer over real NASA reports scores well on Creativity and Relevance. The trap: a chat interface over some PDFs is a 5 on validity. Show the training data, the features, and an honest accuracy figure.

## 48-hour plan

- **Before the event:** Gather microgravity combustion reports from NTRS and OSDR, extract a tabular dataset of conditions and outcomes, and commit both the table and a trained model artifact. Data extraction is the slow part and it must be done in advance.
- **Day 1 morning:** Feature engineering and a baseline classifier with honest cross-validation. Report the accuracy you actually get.
- **Day 1 afternoon:** Serve the model, build the slider interface, show the decision boundary.
- **Day 1 evening:** Retrieval over the report corpus, so each prediction links to the nearest real experiments. Record by 18:30.
- **Day 2 morning:** Uncertainty display, the out-of-range warning, and the safety framing for a spacecraft operator.
- **Day 2 noon:** Freeze, record, submit.

**Pre-build**

- Extracted experiment table
- Report corpus with identifiers
- Trained model artifact committed

**Cut in this order**

- Classification only, drop regression
- Fixed presets instead of free sliders
- Retrieval over titles instead of full text

## Data

- **NTRS** — the primary source. Microgravity combustion reports including the FLEX and SoFIE experiment families, downloadable as PDFs with citable identifiers.
- **NASA OSDR** — spaceflight experiment records and metadata.
- **NASA Glenn physical sciences resources** — combustion experiment documentation and imagery.

> **Critical**
>
> **Never extrapolate silently.** If the requested conditions fall outside the range of your training data, the interface must say so and refuse to predict. A fire-safety tool that quietly guesses is worse than no tool, and a judge will ask.

## Build prompt

**Paste into your coding agent**

```
Build a microgravity fire-safety explorer.

Data: cache/experiments.parquet, one row per published microgravity combustion
test with oxygen_pct, pressure_kpa, flow_cm_s, material, sample geometry, the
observed outcome class, and a report_id plus source_url.

src/compute/model.py: train a small gradient-boosting classifier predicting the
flame-spread regime. Report honest stratified cross-validation accuracy and a
confusion matrix. Save the model artifact to the repo. Compute and store the
min and max of every numeric feature as the training range.

API: POST /predict returning the class, class probabilities, the model metadata
including n_train and cv_accuracy, an in_training_range boolean, and the three
nearest real experiments by feature distance with their report ids and URLs.

If in_training_range is false, return no prediction and an explanation that the
requested conditions are outside the published experimental envelope.

Frontend: sliders for oxygen, pressure and flow, a material selector, a
probability bar, a two-dimensional decision-boundary plot with the real
experiments overlaid as points, and a panel listing the nearest experiments with
clickable citations.

The language model writes the explanation only, from the prediction object and
retrieved report abstracts. It never predicts and never states a number that is
absent from the object. Apache-2.0, public repo.
